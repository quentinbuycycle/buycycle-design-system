## Problem
The existing Buycycle design system components followed exact Figma specifications but lacked modern micro-interactions and tactile feedback that users expect from contemporary web interfaces. Components felt static and provided minimal visual response to user interactions, potentially reducing engagement and perceived quality.

## Solution
Built a comprehensive enhanced component library including Buttons, TextFields, and Controls (Toggle, Checkbox, Radio) with refined dimensions, tactile feedback, and smooth animations following Emil Kowalski's principles. Each component features 200-250ms transitions, transform-only animations for 60fps performance, and scale feedback (0.95 on press, 1.05 on hover).

## UX & UI Rationale
- **Fitts's Law compliance**: Larger touch targets (48px inputs, 60x34px toggles, 26px controls) reduce interaction errors and improve accessibility, especially on mobile devices
- **Immediate feedback principle**: Scale feedback (0.95 on press) and hover states (1.05 scale) provide instant tactile confirmation, satisfying users' need for system response per Nielsen's usability heuristics
- **Gestalt principle of continuity**: Pop-in animations for checkmarks and radio dots (0 → 1.2 → 1 scale) create smooth visual flow rather than abrupt state changes
- **Focus ring accessibility**: 3px shadow rings on focused inputs meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards for keyboard navigation visibility, improving usability for keyboard-only users
- **Progressive disclosure**: Shadow elevation on hover (Primary buttons: 2px → 4px) signals interactivity without overwhelming the interface at rest, following minimalist design principles

## System Limitations
- **No animation guidelines in Figma**: Design system lacks motion specifications, timing curves, or spring physics documentation, forcing developers to invent animation behavior from scratch
- **Missing enhanced variants**: Figma files only contain static baseline states without hover, pressed, or animated variations, creating gaps between design intent and implementation
- **No motion tokens**: Absence of standardized timing values (200ms, 250ms), easing functions (cubic-bezier), or scale values (0.95, 1.05) in design tokens
- **Incomplete focus state guidance**: Design system doesn't specify focus ring dimensions, colors, or shadow values, leading to inconsistent keyboard navigation UX
- **Label typography inconsistency**: Initial specs used 13px labels (not in design system), had to be corrected to 12px (xs token) mid-development
